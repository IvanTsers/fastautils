Package \texttt{fastautils} contains functions that expand the
features of the external package \texttt{fasta} that deals with
biological sequences:
\begin{verbatim}
https://github.com/evolbioinf/fasta
\end{verbatim}
I see the \texttt{fastautils} package as a compromise between
suggesting edits to the original package \texttt{fasta} (which I do
not own), forking it, or embedding it into my custom package. The
direct edits are tempting but they are not always possible and they do
violate the separation of concerns principle. The forking
of \texttt{fasta} spawns a dependency conflict if the fork and the
original package are used together. Finally, I abandoned the idea of
embedding as it quickly became unwieldy and confusing. For example,
this is how I was going to call constructor
method \texttt{NewSequence}:
\begin{verbatim}
func NewSequence(h string, d []byte) *Sequence {
     return &Sequence{
            Sequence: *fasta.NewSequence(h, d)
     }
}
\end{verbatim}
...leave alone the need to convert \texttt{Sequence} back
to \texttt{fasta.Sequence} for compatibility.  Well, perhaps I was
doing it wrong. Ultimately, it would be easier to just write some
straightforward functions, would it not?..
